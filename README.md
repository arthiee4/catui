# CATui: Emulation Frontend

CATui is an emulation frontend built with the **Godot Engine 4.5.1**. It utilizes Libretro-based cores and runs all emulators within a single process, featuring social integration. This repository contains the source code for the client application.

> Status: **developer alpha** - structure and code are subject to frequent changes.

## Emulator Setup

CATui uses **Libretro cores** to run games. You need to download the core DLLs and configure the paths.

### Supported Consoles

...

### Core Setup

To play games, you need to import the correct Libretro Core for your platform.

1.  **Download Core**: Go to the Libretro Buildbot and download the core for your OS:
    *   [Libretro Nightly Buildbot](https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/)
    *   **Windows:** navigate to `windows/x86_64/latest/` and download `.dll` files (e.g., `mgba_libretro.dll`).
    *   **Linux:** (Untested) navigate to `linux/x86_64/latest/` and download `.so` files.
    *   **Android:** navigate to `android/latest/` and download `.so` files. Use `armeabi-v7a` for older devices and `arm64-v8a` for newer devices.

2.  **Import in CATui**:
    *   Open CATui settings.
    *   Go to **Emulation**.
    *   Select **Import Core Manually**.
    *   Choose the core file you downloaded (`.dll` or `.so`).

The emulator will automatically register the core and it will be ready to use!



### Building and Exporting

To generate a distributable executable (the 'compilation' step in Godot):

* **Note:** Soon a detailed guide. Since CATui is in *developer alpha*, there is no final, usable build or export configuration ready for general distribution. This section will be completed before the first public release.
